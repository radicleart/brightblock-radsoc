## Purpose

The internet as we know it is creaking under the strain of its unsound architecture. The original vision for the
internet was a of a place of equal and fair participation that enabled the best of human nature to flourish. As we
now look at it though the internet is a place where we all contribute to the asymmetric wealth and power of a handful
of companies we now call the tech giants.

Radicle Society is a small group from the south coast of England dedicated to helping rebuild the internet on sounder
foundations that allow it to live up to the dreams of the early pioneers.

## Prerequisites

Radicle Society applications are based on Blockstack architecture for decentralised applications. Radicle applications therefore
require user to own their own online blockstack identity.
